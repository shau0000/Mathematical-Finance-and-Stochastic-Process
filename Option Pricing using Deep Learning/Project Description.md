# Project Description
Some students who were already familiar with the introductory topics and had some experience with Deep Learning algorithms also pursued a side-project under Shaurya where they developed deep learning models to outperform the Black-Scholes model in a real setting. The details of this project can also be found in the GitHub link mentioned under ‘Resources’.

## Objective
To provide superior model than Black-Scholes for pricing European call and put options using deep learning algorithms.

## Approach
- Employed MultiLayer Perceptron models using input of the Black-Scholes model & VIX  on Nifty 50 index.
- Implement GARCH  Volatility model and Gaussian process stochastic volatility model to improve model performance.
- Proposed LSTM  to learn deep stochastic volatility and fed through the  MLP architecture to output the equilibrium price.

## Impact
- All  models outperform Black-scholes model while MLP with Gaussian  volatility  to be most successful with MAE of 30.
- Build Fully automated dashboard  provides an evaluation of an option's fair value to users with no extra-effort.
